                            <p>About this mod. The Forgotten City is the first mod in history to win a national Writers' Guild award with its script. It is a critically acclaimed expansion mod offering a unique 6 - 8 hour experience: a murder mystery investigation set in an ancient underground. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an action role-playing game, playable from either a first or third-person perspective.The player may freely roam over the land of Skyrim which is an open world environment consisting of wilderness expanses, dungeons, cities, towns, fortresses, and villages. Adds 223 new sound effects that are played in Skyrim\'s cities, villages and small hamlets. Sounds include city activity (doors, children) , interior weather (thunderstorms) and tavern activity (shouts, crowd) "Skyrim, also known as the Old Kingdom or the Fatherland, was the first region of Tamriel settled by humans from the continent of Atmora: the hardy, brave, warlike Nords, whose descendants still occupy this rugged land.". Swiftly approaching its seventh anniversary, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim still stands as one of the most influential open world RPGs ever to see release. The game is something of a high watermark for the genre, and it exemplified Bethesda’s ability to craft a compelling and extremely diverse narrative that could be experienced a near countless number of times without ever feeling repetitive. This is one of the more fun quests in Skyrim, although it might take a little while to get to it. This one starts at any major city's tavern. Accept Sam Guevenne's drinking contest, but note that the Dragonborn will pass out after three drinks. A corner of the world of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion has arrived in Skyrim with the launch of Beyond Skyrim: Bruma official site , a mod set around Cyrodil’s city of Bruma. Unlike the still-in-development mod remaking Oblivion inside Skyrim, this mod is telling new stories set around

Just give it a try Version  Hi Guys, Just a quick post to inform you all of an awesome achievement for a Mod Author. Nick Pearce, author behind "The Forgotten City" Skyrim mod, just won a AWGIE award (Australian Writers Guild Award) for the mod in the category "Interactive Media" It is an awesome achievement for a mod-author and one which highlights that mod-authors can get industry recognition for their work. The mod itself can be found on Nexus here if you want to experience it and Nick has mentioned 
We've found the best Skyrim mods you should download for Skyrim Special Edition which will fix NPCs, add new combat, and make travelling a lot easier. Is there something I'm doing wrong? When I draw my bow the screen blurs/shakes every 1.5 seconds, and there's no perk (with ordinator mod) that mentions anything about it. I checked some archery gameplay on youtube and none of them seem to get the blurriness/shaking when they draw their bow. I thought it might go away on its own as my archery skill goes up, but it's still happening. Would really appreciate help on this, it's driving me mad because I use my bow all the time. Thanks.

Hey friends, Recently downloaded Skyrim Special Edition to see what the mod scene was like (after modding and enjoying the original). I downloaded some of the top mods from Nexus, and everything in general works swimmingly. There does however seem to be a small graphical glitch that may be caused by one of the weather mods I have installed, but I am not sure. Basically, anytime there is "snowy" weather (snowflakes falling from the sky, or on top of snowy mountain peaks), the Destruction magic. Yep.it's this thread again. I figured I'd start a discussion regarding quest mods once again as many of the most popular ones have been ported to SSE. If you're like me, sometimes you were scared to mess with those mods for LE as LE can be a bit of a fickle bastard if you aren't diligent with your modding practices. I'm currently playing Vigilant and Beyond Skyrim - Bruma as of right now and am enjoying both. I don't particularly have a 'top 5' favorites atm, but really enjoyed Project I know the mod has been out for a long time, and I've had it in my load order for over 2 years, but never actually tried it. And I definitely enjoy it. I haven't really messed with the time travel much other than the first time I discovered the dwarves law, but it's been pretty great nonetheless. It reminds me of fallout in skyrim, and that way it definitely feels like an official dlc. All in all I just want to praise and advocate the mod. If you haven't checked it out, you should.

So I've been playing Skyrim SE for the Xbox One and I'm loving it so far. Only problem is, for some reason none of the White Run citizens that I can normally get miscellaneous quests from in vanilla skyrim are giving me any quests. The dialogue options just simply aren't showing up. Amren won't give me the quest to find his sword, the Battle-Born child won't ask me to help Braith stop bullying him, I can't ask Carlota if she needs help telling the bard to leave her alone, I can't ask Ysolda. So I bought the Ancano 500 gold deck (read a lot that it was the best among 50-theme decks) and I’ve been doing well up to rank 7. I have collected 500 gold again and was wondering what is the next best option to spend my gold on? Do you guys have like an optimal gold-spending order priority that would suit the path that I’m currently on like what I should buy next after that so on and so forth? Thanks.

Thought it might be of interest. Forgotten City Game (https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/319909/Skyrim_mod_rebooted_as_a_fullfledged_Unreal_Engine_4_game.php). Hi folks, It’s been a while. But that Skyrim itch is just too strong. Any good mod lists? Looking for high qualiy expansions and visual updates. Thanks. The modding experience for Skyrim is somewhat crippled because we don't have true access to developer tools. We're forced to work within the crippled confines imposed by bethesda with endless bugs that we have no choice but to work around. I look at all the modding tools put forward, and the large number of quest mods, and the development of Skyrim Together, and all the new gameplay mechanics, graphics, ENB and so on and I think holy s\ \ \  Who better to make a game designed for modding. 
Ever have any conflicts or problems in game? Thanks for your time in advance. Just played through Forgotten City and Falskaar for the first time, and I take my hat off to both authors. The kind of investment needed to make these kind of mods must be staggering. Having said that, I have to say I found the Forgotten City to be much more impressive than Falskaar even though it involved much less playing time. It was clever, well written and really drew you in. It had multiple endings and really good dialogue. Falskaar, on the other hand was largely derivative. I got Skyrim Special edition a few months ago and I'm looking for some mods to make it more interesting. I played the hell out of Skyrim back on my Xbox when it was first released but I migrated to PC and recently rebought it. Now it seems kind of stale so I'm looking to mods to make it better.
